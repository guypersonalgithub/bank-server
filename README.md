# This is the server part of a bank-like Angular project.

The server is written in NodeJS Express, and uses MySQL as its DB.
The project is being hosted [here](https://ecstatic-austin-7e2714.netlify.app/).
The server is hosted on Heroku's free tier, and because of that the first connection to the server might be slow.
